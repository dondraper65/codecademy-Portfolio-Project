## Introduction
This is a **Daily Horoscope Generator** program which provides random strings which tell you how the different aspects of your daily life will pan out.
## Process
This was achieved by creating 3 functions which generate random strings describing Work, Love and mood of the user for the following day. Functions take random numbers in the range of their switch statement cases as arguments.
## Language
*Javascript*
## Decorations
We used ASCII arts to make the message more visually appealing, as nobody wants a dull undecorated horoscope (except accountants probably LOL!)
